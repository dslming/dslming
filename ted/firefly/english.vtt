00:00:06.961 --> 00:00:10.631
You’re a male firefly and it seems
you’re hitting it off with this female.

00:00:10.631 --> 00:00:13.843
She’s sending you the right
signals back— but what’s this?

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:16.012
Suddenly, she’s lunging at you.

00:00:16.179 --> 00:00:17.388
That’s not normal.

00:00:17.472 --> 00:00:19.807
Let’s pause here to understand
what’s going on

00:00:19.807 --> 00:00:21.809
and see if you'll make it out alive.

00:00:22.393 --> 00:00:26.564
The first firefly is thought to have
lived over 100 million years ago,

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:29.525
illuminating the night
with a glowing green light.

00:00:29.901 --> 00:00:33.196
And today, there are
around 2,000 firefly species,

00:00:33.196 --> 00:00:34.655
found all over the world,

00:00:34.781 --> 00:00:38.534
from forests and grasslands
to marshes and deserts.

00:00:39.494 --> 00:00:43.122
All fireflies produce light
at some point in their lives.

00:00:43.289 --> 00:00:47.710
They do this with a reaction-catalyzing
enzyme called luciferase

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:50.088
and a molecule called luciferin,

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.175
which undergoes a luminous transformation
when it interacts with oxygen.

00:00:54.467 --> 00:00:58.763
Meanwhile, many firefly species
also produce unpleasant tasting,

00:00:58.763 --> 00:01:02.350
toxic, defensive chemicals
like lucibufagins.

00:01:02.725 --> 00:01:06.395
So it's thought that glowing
might help signal their toxicity

00:01:06.521 --> 00:01:09.023
and deter predators from eating them.

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:12.860
Developing fireflies also light up
to varying degrees.

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:16.697
In fact, fireflies generally spend
just a few weeks in their adult bodies

00:01:16.697 --> 00:01:19.534
and actually pass most
of their lives as larvae.

00:01:19.826 --> 00:01:24.330
During this stage, many species are
highly active, fierce predators

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.332
that use venom to paralyze prey,

00:01:26.374 --> 00:01:29.919
then externally liquefy
their victims with their saliva.

00:01:30.378 --> 00:01:34.382
Immature fireflies also tend
to glow when they're disturbed.

00:01:34.632 --> 00:01:39.178
When they finally become adults, their
light skills help dissuade predators—

00:01:39.178 --> 00:01:42.515
but they're also usually
channeled towards mating.

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.185
There are some exceptions,
like so-called “dark” fireflies,

00:01:46.185 --> 00:01:47.687
which are active during the day

00:01:47.687 --> 00:01:50.815
and rely on pheromones
instead of light for courtship.

00:01:51.232 --> 00:01:55.736
But how it goes in many cases
is that males fly around, flashing,

00:01:55.736 --> 00:01:58.990
while females observe
until spotting the right one.

00:01:59.365 --> 00:02:01.784
Different species display
different colors—

00:02:01.784 --> 00:02:04.829
including reds, yellows,
greens, and blues—

00:02:04.871 --> 00:02:09.292
all resulting from variation
in the luciferase enzyme’s structure.

00:02:09.458 --> 00:02:14.714
They also flash in unique patterns,
from rapid flickers to sustained glows.

00:02:15.047 --> 00:02:16.299
In some species,

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:20.511
males synchronize their flashing
once they reach great enough numbers,

00:02:20.511 --> 00:02:23.931
resulting in grand displays
that help reduce visual clutter

00:02:23.931 --> 00:02:25.766
for their female spectators.

00:02:25.892 --> 00:02:29.896
And females of just about every species
are looking for something different.

00:02:30.188 --> 00:02:34.567
Cattail flash-train firefly females,
for example, prefer faster flickers,

00:02:34.567 --> 00:02:39.113
while ignited firefly females select
for longer light pulses.

00:02:39.572 --> 00:02:40.907
Compared to males,

00:02:40.907 --> 00:02:45.411
female fireflies tend to keep their
bioluminescent signals pretty simple.

00:02:45.494 --> 00:02:49.248
Generally, an interested female
will point her lantern at a chosen male

00:02:49.248 --> 00:02:52.084
and respond to his flashes,
drawing him in.

00:02:52.168 --> 00:02:56.839
Successful matches may mate for hours,
attached at the abdomen.

00:02:56.923 --> 00:02:59.342
But things don’t always go so smoothly,

00:02:59.634 --> 00:03:02.511
which takes us back
to that conspicuous lunge.

00:03:02.678 --> 00:03:05.681
Many fireflies don't even eat as adults,

00:03:05.681 --> 00:03:10.770
instead channeling all the energy
they stored as larvae into finding mates.

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:14.857
But that's not the case
for the females of one genus of fireflies.

00:03:15.066 --> 00:03:17.109
They are called femme fatales,

00:03:17.109 --> 00:03:21.989
and they're predators that hunt
the adult males of other firefly species.

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:23.908
Despite being much larger,

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:27.745
femme fatales lure males by mimicking
the unique flashing patterns

00:03:27.745 --> 00:03:30.164
the females of their species give off.

00:03:30.331 --> 00:03:34.085
Then, instead of mating,
they attack and eat them.

00:03:34.335 --> 00:03:37.922
But femme fatales are after more
than just nutritious snacks:

00:03:38.047 --> 00:03:40.633
they lack their own natural toxins

00:03:40.633 --> 00:03:45.179
and are able to sequester those of other
species when they consume them.

00:03:45.304 --> 00:03:49.517
And this similarly helps make them
unappealing to would-be predators.

00:03:49.767 --> 00:03:54.272
But the males they aim to prey on
seem to also have defense strategies.

00:03:54.397 --> 00:03:57.817
One research team observed that males
often approached femme fatales

00:03:57.817 --> 00:04:01.862
with caution and dodged attacks
by dropping several centimeters.

00:04:02.029 --> 00:04:06.742
In fact, they estimated that less than 10%
of femme fatale hunts are successful.

00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:11.122
Interestingly, this isn't the only
time firefly flashes are channeled

00:04:11.122 --> 00:04:13.541
towards more deceptive means.

00:04:13.791 --> 00:04:18.587
Certain Chinese orb-weaver spiders
have been observed to wrap fireflies

00:04:18.587 --> 00:04:19.755
in their webs, 

00:04:19.755 --> 00:04:23.801
keeping them alive so they attract
others to the sticky trap.

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:29.348
The spiders even seem to make captured
males adopt female flashing patterns

00:04:29.348 --> 00:04:32.810
in order to bait other males
on the search for a mate.

00:04:33.227 --> 00:04:34.979
So, as a male firefly,

00:04:35.021 --> 00:04:39.066
while the right bright signal could mean
the hard-fought promise of progeny,

00:04:39.191 --> 00:04:43.529
it's best to beware of the treacherous
tricks light can play.
