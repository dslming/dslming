00:00:06.544 --> 00:00:11.049
In one of Aesop’s 2,500-year-old fables,
a crow is searching for water.

00:00:12.592 --> 00:00:15.428
It spies a pitcher
and discovers liquid inside—

00:00:16.637 --> 00:00:18.097
but it's beyond reach.

00:00:18.556 --> 00:00:21.768
Soon, the crow begins dropping
pebbles into the pitcher.

00:00:22.143 --> 00:00:26.355
One by one, they displace the water,
and the crow quenches its thirst.

00:00:27.315 --> 00:00:30.526
Interestingly, this fable turns out
to be pretty accurate.

00:00:30.651 --> 00:00:32.361
In a 2014 experiment,

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:36.324
scientists placed a food reward
in a tube partially filled with water

00:00:36.491 --> 00:00:39.994
and watched as crow after crow
dropped stone after stone in

00:00:39.994 --> 00:00:42.455
until the food was
in beak-snatching distance.

00:00:43.164 --> 00:00:47.418
This is just one of many fascinating
displays of intelligence from corvids—

00:00:47.627 --> 00:00:49.921
the bold, brainy family of songbirds

00:00:49.921 --> 00:00:53.091
that includes crows, ravens,
jays, and magpies.

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.678
To start, corvids are strategic
when it comes to their food.

00:00:58.096 --> 00:01:02.100
They ransack trash bins and snatch
bites from under other birds’ beaks.

00:01:03.476 --> 00:01:05.520
They also hoard and cache their food.

00:01:05.895 --> 00:01:08.314
A single Clark's nutcracker, for instance,

00:01:08.439 --> 00:01:13.402
is thought to scatter some 30,000 pine
nuts across more than 2,000 cache sites,

00:01:13.569 --> 00:01:16.155
which it can recover more
than nine months later.

00:01:16.989 --> 00:01:20.743
And in one experiment, scrub jays
given waxworms and peanuts

00:01:20.868 --> 00:01:24.914
cached and retrieved the perishable worms
first and left the peanuts for later.

00:01:25.915 --> 00:01:28.918
It seemed the jays not only
recalled where they buried things,

00:01:28.918 --> 00:01:31.003
but also what they buried and when.

00:01:31.462 --> 00:01:35.007
What's more, experiments show
that scrub jays will bury food

00:01:35.007 --> 00:01:37.468
when they know it won’t be available
the next day,

00:01:37.468 --> 00:01:39.846
suggesting they can plan
for future events too.

00:01:40.596 --> 00:01:43.599
And corvid abilities extend
beyond meal prepping.

00:01:43.975 --> 00:01:47.979
In one experiment, a masked person
trapped and released a wild crow.

00:01:49.397 --> 00:01:53.067
When the masked person returned,
crows dive-bombed them.

00:01:54.694 --> 00:01:57.822
If they wore a different mask,
however, they were ignored,

00:01:57.989 --> 00:02:01.492
suggesting that corvids can
distinguish between— and remember—

00:02:01.492 --> 00:02:03.703
different human facial characteristics.

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:09.458
Crows also tend to gather around the
bodies of their dead companions and caw—

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:12.295
a behavior sometimes likened to a funeral.

00:02:12.962 --> 00:02:16.799
And one study showed that crows
were slower to return to an area

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:18.509
where they’d seen a dead companion,

00:02:18.759 --> 00:02:21.137
suggesting they associated it with risk.

00:02:24.974 --> 00:02:27.476
Corvids like New Caledonian crows

00:02:27.518 --> 00:02:31.606
also demonstrate an impressive proclivity
for reasoning and tool use.

00:02:32.815 --> 00:02:37.111
Even in the wild, they fashion sticks
into hook-shaped probes for food.

00:02:37.486 --> 00:02:41.657
Some Japanese crows have been observed
placing nuts on the road, waiting nearby,

00:02:41.657 --> 00:02:45.119
then retrieving the rewards once
passing cars have cracked them open.

00:02:45.912 --> 00:02:48.539
But corvids also do things
that are harder to explain.

00:02:48.623 --> 00:02:50.750
They sometimes tote trinkets around,

00:02:51.042 --> 00:02:55.588
which might help them practice caching
or serve as gifts to their partners.

00:02:56.339 --> 00:03:00.635
And they've been spotted repeatedly
sledding down roofs on plastic lids.

00:03:00.968 --> 00:03:04.305
Play activities like this
are relatively common in corvids,

00:03:04.305 --> 00:03:05.890
especially juveniles.

00:03:06.432 --> 00:03:09.644
Corvids have a longer developmental
period than other songbirds.

00:03:09.644 --> 00:03:11.979
And it’s thought that play
encourages learning

00:03:12.021 --> 00:03:15.066
and lays a strong foundation
for their intelligent behavior.

00:03:16.192 --> 00:03:18.569
Some researchers think cleverness
is crucial

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:20.696
to the highly social lives of corvids.

00:03:20.988 --> 00:03:22.490
They breed cooperatively;

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:24.909
live and communicate
in large dynamic groups;

00:03:24.992 --> 00:03:27.453
share food;
and mob predators together.

00:03:28.412 --> 00:03:32.208
Some have lifelong partnerships
where they recognize their companions,

00:03:32.208 --> 00:03:36.379
and track, respond to, and even predict
each other's behaviors and desires.

00:03:37.546 --> 00:03:41.008
Scientists today consider corvids
among the smartest animals—

00:03:41.008 --> 00:03:43.386
a big step from where
consensus used to be.

00:03:43.844 --> 00:03:47.890
In the late 1800s, German scientist
Ludwig Edinger

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:50.017
compared primate and crow brains

00:03:50.059 --> 00:03:52.853
and interpreted the crow’s brain structure
as primitive,

00:03:52.853 --> 00:03:54.981
dismissing their cognitive abilities.

00:03:55.606 --> 00:03:57.400
This was a misinterpretation.

00:03:57.566 --> 00:03:58.776
A raven, for example,

00:03:58.776 --> 00:04:02.154
has a brain that looks quite different
than a Capuchin monkeys—

00:04:02.154 --> 00:04:04.031
and is about a third of the size.

00:04:04.615 --> 00:04:07.994
But both animals have a similar number
of neurons in their pallium,

00:04:08.077 --> 00:04:10.579
a brain region that’s associated
with cognition.

00:04:11.622 --> 00:04:13.207
So while corvid brains travelled

00:04:13.207 --> 00:04:16.210
a very different evolutionary
path than primate brains,

00:04:16.502 --> 00:04:19.505
it was still one that brought
them sophisticated cognition.

00:04:20.214 --> 00:04:23.509
The next time you spot a crow,
you can be assured of its smarts.

00:04:24.218 --> 00:04:27.388
Just maybe don’t give it
a bad reason to remember you.
