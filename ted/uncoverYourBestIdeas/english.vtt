00:00:06.794 --> 00:00:09.213
Language builds our world.

00:00:09.547 --> 00:00:12.133
Our ideas make us who we are.

00:00:12.592 --> 00:00:17.597
And speakers who have figured out how
to spread their ideas into others’ minds

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.808
have the power to make
an incredible impact.

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.855
Now ask yourself: do you have ideas
that deserve a wider audience?

00:00:27.023 --> 00:00:29.567
That can be a difficult
question to answer.

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:34.405
Many people don't realize just
how many valuable ideas they have.

00:00:34.822 --> 00:00:40.578
You are the only you that's existed
in all of human history.

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:44.290
Your experiences are yours
and yours alone.

00:00:44.582 --> 00:00:46.834
Some of those experiences have taught
you things

00:00:46.834 --> 00:00:50.004
that are absolutely worth sharing
with an audience.

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.175
You just have to figure out
which experiences those are.

00:00:54.884 --> 00:00:57.804
You may feel that you haven't
done anything exciting enough

00:00:57.804 --> 00:00:59.013
to give a talk about.

00:00:59.222 --> 00:01:04.519
Maybe you tell yourself, “I’m not
very creative” or, “I’m not very smart.”

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:08.106
Maybe you can't think of anything
you feel passionate about right now.

00:01:08.356 --> 00:01:10.566
Well, that's a tricky place to start.

00:01:10.942 --> 00:01:12.610
But you don’t need to worry.

00:01:12.652 --> 00:01:18.116
Because, the truth is, everyone
has a great talk idea inside of them.

00:01:18.324 --> 00:01:21.285
Sometimes it just takes
a little digging to find it.

00:01:22.078 --> 00:01:25.498
One reason you may not
recognize your great ideas

00:01:25.498 --> 00:01:28.501
is that you have always been you.

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:31.504
You only see yourself from the inside.

00:01:31.879 --> 00:01:36.425
You may not notice the things that other
people find remarkable about you.

00:01:36.801 --> 00:01:40.721
That’s why one good way to uncover
your talk-worthy ideas

00:01:40.721 --> 00:01:44.350
is to have conversations
with the people who know you best.

00:01:44.684 --> 00:01:46.853
They might be able to see
things about you

00:01:46.853 --> 00:01:49.355
that you aren’t able to see
about yourself—

00:01:49.522 --> 00:01:52.275
things that would be worth sharing
with an audience.

00:01:52.525 --> 00:01:56.737
There is one thing you have
that no one else in the world has,

00:01:56.863 --> 00:01:58.906
and that is your experience.

00:01:59.157 --> 00:02:02.160
So another way to uncover
your great ideas

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.037
is to ask yourself questions
about your life.

00:02:05.371 --> 00:02:10.001
What was the last thing you were
really excited by? Or angered by?

00:02:10.293 --> 00:02:12.587
What are some of the things
that bring you joy?

00:02:12.628 --> 00:02:14.005
What annoys you?

00:02:14.338 --> 00:02:16.132
What's something you're proud of?

00:02:16.465 --> 00:02:18.426
Is there something you know
a lot about?

00:02:18.467 --> 00:02:21.137
A subject you could talk about for hours?

00:02:21.262 --> 00:02:25.016
Is there anything your community
could teach other communities?

00:02:25.224 --> 00:02:28.686
What's a change you would like
to see in the world?

00:02:28.895 --> 00:02:31.189
If you could wave a magic wand,

00:02:31.189 --> 00:02:36.485
what's the one idea you'd most love
to spread to other people's minds?

00:02:36.736 --> 00:02:40.281
Spend some time walking around
open to the possibility

00:02:40.281 --> 00:02:44.911
that some part of your unique journey
could be interesting and helpful

00:02:44.911 --> 00:02:46.704
for an audience to learn about.

00:02:46.871 --> 00:02:50.458
Many wonderful talks are based
on a personal story

00:02:50.458 --> 00:02:53.377
and a simple lesson the speaker
took away from it.

00:02:53.753 --> 00:02:57.215
Your idea could even be a question
you're curious about.

00:02:57.548 --> 00:03:01.844
The search for an answer to your question
could be the basis for your talk.

00:03:01.969 --> 00:03:04.263
What are the issues that matter
most to you?

00:03:04.263 --> 00:03:07.725
What are the riddles that people
don't yet have good answers for?

00:03:07.975 --> 00:03:10.269
If you have a subject
you’d like to talk about,

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:13.064
but aren't sure you
really know enough yet,

00:03:13.314 --> 00:03:17.526
why not use your public speaking
opportunity as a way to find out more?

00:03:17.526 --> 00:03:20.363
In other words, you don’t need
to have the perfect knowledge

00:03:20.363 --> 00:03:21.739
in your head today.

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:25.034
You could use your talk as the reason
to discover more

00:03:25.034 --> 00:03:27.203
about something that interests you.

00:03:27.411 --> 00:03:31.290
The only thing that truly matters
in public speaking is not confidence,

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.709
stage presence, or smooth talking.

00:03:33.834 --> 00:03:36.003
It's having something worth saying.
