00:00:07.211 --> 00:00:10.757
Many of you here have probably
heard of the 10,000 hours rule.

00:00:10.965 --> 00:00:13.509
It’s the idea that to become great
in anything takes

00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:15.928
10,000 hours of focused practice.

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:18.514
So you’d better get started
as early as possible.

00:00:18.639 --> 00:00:22.268
The poster child for this story
is Tiger Woods.

00:00:22.477 --> 00:00:25.897
His father famously gave him a putter
when he was seven months old.

00:00:25.938 --> 00:00:29.192
Fast forward to the age of 21—
he’s the greatest golfer in the world.

00:00:29.192 --> 00:00:31.110
Quintessential 10,000 hours story.

00:00:31.319 --> 00:00:33.529
Another is that of the three
Polgar sisters,

00:00:33.529 --> 00:00:36.699
whose father decided to teach them chess
in a very technical manner

00:00:36.699 --> 00:00:38.076
from a very early age.

00:00:38.159 --> 00:00:41.204
Two of his daughters went on to become
grandmaster chess players

00:00:41.204 --> 00:00:43.956
I got curious: if this 10,000 hours rule
is correct,

00:00:43.956 --> 00:00:46.542
then we should see that elite athletes
get a head start

00:00:46.542 --> 00:00:48.336
in so-called deliberate practice.

00:00:48.336 --> 00:00:50.671
And in fact,
when scientists study elite athletes,

00:00:50.671 --> 00:00:53.591
they see that they spend more time
in deliberate practice.

00:00:53.716 --> 00:00:55.009
Not a big surprise.

00:00:55.009 --> 00:00:58.387
When they actually track athletes
over the course of their development,

00:00:58.387 --> 00:00:59.806
the pattern looks like this:

00:00:59.806 --> 00:01:03.351
the future elites tend to have what
scientists call a sampling period,

00:01:03.351 --> 00:01:05.603
where they try a variety
of physical activities.

00:01:05.603 --> 00:01:09.023
They gain broad general skills
and delay specializing

00:01:09.023 --> 00:01:11.567
until later than peers who plateau
at lower levels.

00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:15.071
That doesn’t really comport with
the 10,000 hours rule, does it?

00:01:15.071 --> 00:01:17.907
So I started to wonder about other
domains that we associate

00:01:17.907 --> 00:01:21.119
with obligatory early specialization,
like music.

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.995
Turns out the pattern is often similar.

00:01:22.995 --> 00:01:26.791
The exceptional musicians didn’t start
spending more time in deliberate practice

00:01:26.791 --> 00:01:29.585
than the average musicians
until their third instrument.

00:01:29.585 --> 00:01:31.712
They too tended to have a sampling period.

00:01:31.712 --> 00:01:35.216
Even musicians we think of as
famously precocious, like Yo-Yo Ma.

00:01:35.216 --> 00:01:38.427
So this got me interested in exploring
the developmental backgrounds

00:01:38.427 --> 00:01:40.429
of people whose work I had long admired.

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:42.765
Duke Ellington shunned music lessons
as a kid

00:01:42.765 --> 00:01:45.017
to focus on baseball and painting
and drawing.

00:01:45.017 --> 00:01:47.687
Mariam Mirzakhani wasn’t interested
in math as a girl,

00:01:47.687 --> 00:01:49.230
dreamed of becoming a novelist,

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:53.025
and went on to become the first and so far
only woman to win the Fields Medal,

00:01:53.025 --> 00:01:55.278
the most prestigious prize
in the world in math.

00:01:55.278 --> 00:01:59.740
Vincent van Gogh had five different
careers before flaming out spectacularly,

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:00.825
and, in his late 20s,

00:02:00.825 --> 00:02:04.078
picked up a book called
“The Guide to the ABCs of Drawing.”

00:02:04.203 --> 00:02:07.540
Claude Shannon was an electrical engineer
at the University of Michigan

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:10.334
who took a philosophy course just
to fulfill a requirement.

00:02:10.334 --> 00:02:13.671
And in it he learned about a near
century-old system of logic

00:02:13.671 --> 00:02:16.841
by which true and false statements
could be coded as ones and zeros

00:02:16.841 --> 00:02:18.384
and solved like math problems.

00:02:18.467 --> 00:02:20.803
This led to the development
of binary code,

00:02:20.803 --> 00:02:23.806
which underlies all
of our digital computers today.

00:02:23.806 --> 00:02:27.602
Frances Hesselbein took her first
professional job at the age of 54,

00:02:27.602 --> 00:02:30.146
and went on to become the CEO
of the Girl Scouts.

00:02:30.271 --> 00:02:32.064
Here’s an athlete I’ve followed.

00:02:32.064 --> 00:02:34.650
He tried some tennis,
some skiing, wrestling.

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.527
His mother was actually a tennis coach,

00:02:36.527 --> 00:02:39.947
but she declined to coach him because
he wouldn’t return balls normally.

00:02:39.947 --> 00:02:41.449
And he kept trying more sports:

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:44.368
handball, volleyball, soccer,
badminton, skateboarding.

00:02:44.452 --> 00:02:45.953
So who is this dabbler?

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:47.580
This is Roger Federer.

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:50.917
Every bit as famous
as an adult as Tiger Woods.

00:02:50.917 --> 00:02:54.295
And yet even tennis enthusiasts
don't usually know anything

00:02:54.295 --> 00:02:55.755
about his developmental story.

00:02:55.796 --> 00:02:56.797
Why is that?

00:02:56.797 --> 00:02:59.675
I think it’s partly because
the Tiger story is very dramatic,

00:02:59.675 --> 00:03:02.011
but also because it seems
like this tidy narrative

00:03:02.011 --> 00:03:05.848
that we can extrapolate to anything that
we want to be good at in our own lives.

00:03:05.973 --> 00:03:09.227
But it turns out that in many ways,
golf is a uniquely horrible model

00:03:09.227 --> 00:03:11.437
of almost everything that humans
want to learn.

00:03:11.437 --> 00:03:14.148
Golf is the epitome of what the
psychologist Robin Hogarth

00:03:14.148 --> 00:03:15.858
called a kind learning environment.

00:03:15.858 --> 00:03:20.029
Next steps and goals are clear;
rules that are clear and never change.

00:03:20.363 --> 00:03:23.908
When you do something, you get feedback
that is quick and accurate.

00:03:24.116 --> 00:03:26.577
Chess, also a kind learning environment.

00:03:26.744 --> 00:03:29.830
On the other end of the spectrum
are wicked learning environments

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:33.584
where next steps and goals may not
be clear— rules may change.

00:03:33.626 --> 00:03:36.170
You may or may not get feedback
when you do something,

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:38.214
it may be delayed, it may be inaccurate.

00:03:38.214 --> 00:03:41.717
Which one of these sounds like
the world we're increasingly living in?

00:03:41.717 --> 00:03:45.596
So if hyper-specialization isn’t always
the trick in a wicked world, what is?

00:03:45.721 --> 00:03:47.473
That can be difficult to talk about,

00:03:47.473 --> 00:03:51.435
because sometimes it looks like meandering
or zigzagging or keeping a broader view.

00:03:51.435 --> 00:03:52.979
It can look like getting behind.

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:55.564
But if we look at research
on technological innovation,

00:03:55.564 --> 00:03:58.693
it shows that increasingly the most
impactful patents are authored

00:03:58.693 --> 00:04:01.028
by teams that include individuals

00:04:01.028 --> 00:04:04.282
who have worked across a large
number of different technology classes

00:04:04.282 --> 00:04:06.450
and often merge things
from different domains.

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:09.954
Someone whose work I've admired,
who was sort of on the forefront of this,

00:04:09.954 --> 00:04:11.747
is a Japanese man named Junpei Yokoi.

00:04:11.747 --> 00:04:14.542
Yokoi didn't score well
in his electronics exams at school,

00:04:14.542 --> 00:04:17.837
so he had to settle for a low-tier job
as a machine maintenance worker

00:04:17.837 --> 00:04:19.547
at a playing card company in Kyoto.

00:04:19.547 --> 00:04:22.758
He combined some well-known
technology from the calculator industry,

00:04:22.758 --> 00:04:25.761
with some well-known technology
from the credit card industry,

00:04:25.761 --> 00:04:26.929
and made handheld games.

00:04:26.929 --> 00:04:29.098
And it turned this playing card company,

00:04:29.098 --> 00:04:32.059
which was founded in a wooden storefront
in the 19th century,

00:04:32.059 --> 00:04:33.853
into a toy and game operation.

00:04:33.853 --> 00:04:36.063
You may have heard of it,
it’s called Nintendo.

00:04:36.063 --> 00:04:38.024
His magnum opus was the Game Boy.

00:04:38.316 --> 00:04:41.235
We probably don't make
as many of those people as we could,

00:04:41.235 --> 00:04:43.946
because we don't tend to incentivize
anything that doesn't

00:04:43.946 --> 00:04:45.948
look like a head start or specialization.

00:04:46.115 --> 00:04:50.077
And naturally, I think there are as many
ways to succeed as there are people,

00:04:50.077 --> 00:04:53.914
but I think we tend only to incentivize
and encourage the Tiger path,

00:04:53.914 --> 00:04:56.375
when increasingly, in a wicked world,
we need people

00:04:56.375 --> 00:04:58.252
who travel the Roger path as well.

00:04:58.377 --> 00:05:01.422
Or as the eminent physicist and
mathematician and writer

00:05:01.422 --> 00:05:02.965
Freeman Dyson put it:

00:05:02.965 --> 00:05:06.594
“For a healthy ecosystem,
we need both birds and frogs.

00:05:06.719 --> 00:05:09.722
Frogs are down in the mud
seeing all the granular details.

00:05:09.722 --> 00:05:12.516
The birds are soaring up above,
not seeing those details,

00:05:12.516 --> 00:05:14.602
but integrating
the knowledge of the frogs.”

00:05:14.602 --> 00:05:15.644
And we need both.

00:05:15.644 --> 00:05:19.899
The problem, Dyson said, is that we’re
telling everyone to become frogs.

00:05:20.149 --> 00:05:23.736
And I think in a wicked world,
that's increasingly shortsighted.
